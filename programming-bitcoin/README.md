This folder contains some code/notes for my study of "Programming Bitcoin" by Jimmy Song ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Bitcoin-Learn-Program-Scratch/dp/1492031496))

Setup:
```
cd ~/my-library/programming-bitcoin/programmingbitcoin
. .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ jupyter notebook
```

This opens a Jupyter notebook in the browser.
