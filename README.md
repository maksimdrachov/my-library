Title |  Notes
---------|---------
 Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces | Very in-depth look at different OS concepts, and surprisingly funny at times.
 Embedded Systems Architecture (by Daniele Lacamera) | Covers most of the basics that are necessary for embedded programming, currently re-reading to further absorb the material. 
 The C Programming Language | A classic on C. Didn't finish completely, but maybe worth coming back to in the future.
